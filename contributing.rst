Leave Detailed Commit Messages
******************************

Commit messages should clearly explain the intent of the change. The goal
is to have the summary have an as-clear-as possible explanation of the change,
and to explain the intent in the description.

You can see an example `here <https://github.com/zillow/tycho/commit/a2f3d1fced763986fa8bd79a7d7884174217537>`_.

This can also happen as part of the PR process. PRs are squashed and merged to
ensure a concise history and functional units of change that can be examined accordingly.
